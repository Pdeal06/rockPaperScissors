What I'm creating is a script that allows someone to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer 
in the console. The script should take a user prompt of 1 of the choices compare it against the randomized 
choice by the computer and determine the winner. Eventually, they want a 5 round game that keeps score and 
prints who the winner is in the end.
